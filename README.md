# C#-PROJECTS
This repository is a collection of small coding exercises and projects that I created using C# and the .NET Framework.
## Projects:
- TwentyOne
- CarInsurance
- EFCodeFirstConsoleApp
- LiveServerTime

### TwentyOne
TwentyOne Console Game is a C# console application that simulates the classic Blackjack casino game. It offers engaging gameplay with interactive responses, recreating the feel of a real casino environment. Players face off against the dealer, make strategic choices, and enjoy dynamic feedback that enhances the overall experience. This project was developed in collaboration with a Tech Academy instructor, and it provided me with valuable learning opportunities throughout the process.

### CarInsurance
This project is an MVC-based web application that simulates a car insurance platform. It collects user input related to policy details and generates a quote using predefined business logic. Additionally, it includes an admin interface where staff members can review all submitted insurance quotes.

### EFCodeFirstConsoleApp
EFCodeFirstConsoleApp is a simple console application built with C# using the Entity Framework Code-First approach. It demonstrates how to define a data model in code, generate a corresponding database, and perform basic data operations. In this project, a student database is created and populated with a sample entry, showcasing foundational concepts of EF Core and database interaction in a console environment.

### LiveServerTime
LiveServerTime is an ASP.NET Core web application designed to simulate real-time server clock display in the browser. The project demonstrates how to fetch and present the current server time dynamically, offering users an up-to-date and responsive experience. This project showcases core web development concepts such as server-client communication and real-time data rendering.
